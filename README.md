BeerChooser Relaunch for iOS

BeerChooser was the first iOS app I created back in 2010. It was a featured app in the Lifestyle section of the App Store. I'm working on a completely new relaunch of the app using everything I've learned since then to make it way more awesome.


Features
===========
* Rank beers you've tried and keep track of them
* Get suggestions of new beers to try
* Get predicted ratings of new beers when you're trying to decide what to order
* Uses machine learning to take existing beer ratings and create predictions for new beers based on over 200,000 user beer ratings I've collected.
